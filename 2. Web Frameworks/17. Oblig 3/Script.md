### What is universal design?

Universal design is a design philosophy whose goal is to make products and environments usable by everyone, without requiring special adaptation.

It can be applied to many different domains, such as:

- Buildings
- Vehicles
- Software
- Public services

### The 7 principles of Universal Design

#### 1 Equitable use

The design should be usable by anyone, regardless of disabilities or other limitations.

#### 2 Flexibility in use

The design should support multiple ways of operation, accommodating diverse user preferences and abilities.

#### 3 Simple and intuitive

It should be easy to understand how to interact with and use the design, regardless of experience, knowledge or concentration level.

#### 4 Perceptible information

The design should communicate information in a multimodal fashion(visually, auditory or physical), to the benefit of users with differing sensory abilities or in varying circumstances.

#### 5 Tolerance for error

The design should minimize the impact of unintended or accidental interactions,
and provide constructive feedback to help users recover and learn.

#### 6 Low physical effort

The design should be efficient and comfortable to use, requiring minimal physical exertion. 

#### 7 Size and space for approach and use

The design should be appropriate for users with varying body sizes, postures and mobility.

### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is a set of four principles which aim to promote the usability of websites for users with disabilities, It is maintained and developed by the World Wide Web Consortium.

The principles have several criteria, allowing for webpages to be scored on WCAG conformity.

#### 1 Percievable

Users must be able to either see or hear the content. Text should be readable by screen readers, videos should have captions, and images should have descriptive alternative text.

#### 2 Operable

Users must be able to navigate and interact with the website using different input methods, such as keyboard, mouse or touch. 


#### 3 Understandable

Users must be able to understand both how to interact with the website and the information it provides.
Navigation should be consistent across pages, and interactive elements like buttons and links should behave predictably.
Language should be clear and not unnecessarily complex.

#### 4 Robust

Content must be compatible with a wide array of current and future user agents (browsers on mobile and desktop devices), as well as assistive technologies.

### Particulars of principle 2 - *Operable*

*Operable* concerns itself with ensuring that websites are usable by all users regardless of input method or device.

The principle is subdivided into five groups, each containing several success criteria.

1. Keyboard accessible

The main goal is to ensure all functionality of a website is available using only a keyboard. The success criteria detail requirements concerning fluidity of keyboard focus, shortcut management and non-reliance on timed keystrokes. 

2. Enough time

Users must have enough time to read and use content.
They must have the ability to pause or extend content time limits.
Re-authenticating expired sessions should not cause data loss.

3. Seizures and Physical reactions

The user should not be exposed to repeated visual flashes which may induce seizures or other physical reactions. 

4. Navigable

Websites must support users that interact with them in non-standard ways:
- Provide a way to skip repeated content
- Using descriptive titles, headers, and labels.
- Maintain a clear visual indication of keyboard focus

5. Input Modalities

The criteria of the Input Modalities principle all promote usability of the website by users who rely on non-keyboard input devices:

- Mouse
- Touch screen
- Stylus (electronic pen)
- Pointer devices
